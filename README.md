# OnlyOneShooter

_Name pending... someone help us come up with a better one :)_

OnlyOneShooter is a top down shooter where you fight only a single enemy - multiple times. This game is developed by [Kyle Reese](https://github.com/kdreese) and [Terry Hearst](https://github.com/thearst3rd) as a warmup game for us to get more comfortable developing games for game jams. It uses the amazing [Love2D game framework](https://love2d.org/).

## Running the game

### Download dependancies

The only dependancy of this project is [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) version [11.3](https://love2d.org/wiki/11.3). Other versions might work, but 11.3 is the most recent version as of writing and it's the version we used to develop this game.

### Run the game in Love2D

To run the game, either clone the repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), or download the sources as a zip file from GitHub and extract it. In a command line, `cd` into the sources directory and run the command `love .` (assuming Love2D is on your `PATH`).

All in one commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thearst3rd/OnlyOneShooter
cd OnlyOneShooter
love .
```

On Windows, you can also drag the sources folder onto `love.exe` or a shortcut of `love.exe`, and that will work as well.
